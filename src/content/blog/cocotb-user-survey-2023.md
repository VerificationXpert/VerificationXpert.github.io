[The 2023 Cocotb user survey](https://www.cocotb.org/2023/06/17/user-survey-2023.html) provided valuable insights into the user experience and highlighted critical areas for improvement. The survey revealed a positive reception of Cocotb among its users, with many appreciating its functionality and alignment with development priorities. However, it also identified significant areas needing enhancement, most notably in learning resources and verification IP.

A key finding from the survey was the need for improved educational materials. Users expressed a clear need for more tutorials and learning resources, as well as better documentation. This highlights the importance of having proper training material and courses for Cocotb users. The lack of such resources can be a barrier to entry for new users and hinder the efficient utilization of Cocotb by existing users. Adequate tutorials and learning materials not only facilitate easier onboarding but also enhance the overall user experience by providing clear guidance and best practices.

Additionally, the survey results indicated a desire for more verification IP, with 41% of users seeking enhanced access to these resources. Verification IP (VIP) is crucial for effectively testing and verifying designs, and the lack of it can limit Cocotb's utility in certain projects. This underscores the importance of developing and providing robust verification IPs that can cater to diverse testing needs.

Furthermore, the survey reflected a demand for commercial support and training, with 33% of users expressing interest in commercial support and 26% in commercial training. This points to a broader need within the Cocotb community for professional guidance and training options that can help users leverage Cocotb more effectively in their projects. The uncertainty about the maturity and future of Cocotb, as indicated by 31% of the respondents, also suggests a need for clearer communication and demonstration of the tool's reliability and roadmap.

In summary, the 2023 Cocotb user survey highlights the critical need for enhanced learning resources, including tutorials, documentation, and training materials. It also emphasizes the importance of developing comprehensive verification IPs and providing robust commercial support to meet the growing and diverse needs of the Cocotb user base​​​​​​.
