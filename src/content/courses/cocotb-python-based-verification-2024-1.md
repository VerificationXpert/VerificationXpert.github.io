**Starting soon: June 2024 Session**

Welcome to **Cocotb: Python-Based RTL Verification** a course designed to equip you with the cutting-edge skills needed in the ever-evolving field of semiconductor verification. In the semiconductor industry, the role of verification is paramount, often dictating the success and timelines of chip development projects. 

## Shortage of Verifcation Engineers
The semiconductor industry is facing a significant imbalance in the demand and availability of verification engineers compared to RTL designers. Industry practices often recommend a design to verification ratio of 1:2, meaning two verification engineers for every designer. This ratio highlights the immense importance and volume of work involved in verification, which typically consumes about 80% of the project time due to its complexity and the need to ensure high-quality, defect-free chips. 

>However, many companies are struggling to meet this standard due to a shortage of verification engineers, leading them to temporarily assign RTL designers to perform verification tasks. 

The use of methodologies like UVM has become prevalent as it provides a structured approach to verification, but even this is not sufficient to meet the growing demands efficiently. The introduction and training in comprehensive verification strategies, including RTL verification, are crucial for developing the necessary workforce to handle these critical tasks effectively [[which-field-of-dvlsi-has-more-demand-rtl-or-verification]](https://www.bertverrycken.com/blog/entry/which-field-of-dvlsi-has-more-demand-rtl-or-verification/)
.

Verification productivity is a key factor in meeting the strict schedules of chip tapeouts.

## Why Python for RTL Verifcation?
Python, renowned for its simplicity and efficiency, is increasingly being adopted for RTL verification tasks. This course focuses on Cocotb, a Python-based simulation environment, which, while not a replacement for UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)-based verification, offers a complementary approach that can significantly enhance the verification process. Cocotb allows RTL designers to perform rigorous unit and block-level testing early in the development cycle, helping to identify and resolve bugs more swiftly and effectively.

Through this course, you will learn not only the industry practices surrounding various verification methods but also how leveraging Python through Cocotb can streamline and improve the verification stages, thereby accelerating project timelines without compromising on quality. Whether you are aiming to become a verification engineer or a more versatile RTL designer, this course will provide you with a practical, hands-on understanding of how to apply these skills directly to real-world challenges.
